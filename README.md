## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Learn about creating responsive images using html

```html
<img srcset="path 375w, path 768w" sizes="(max-width: 375px) 375px, 768px" />
```

or

```html
<picture>
  <source media="(max-width: 375px)" srcset="path" />
  <source media="(mix-width: 375px)" srcset="path" />
  <img src="path" alt="alt" />
</picture>
```

### Continued development

I want to look into displaying responsive image using html.

### Useful resources

- [MDN docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Responsive_images) - Read out the responsive image here. I prefer using the picture element with source element for different screen resolution.
